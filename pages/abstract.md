# Abstract

Social media has become a fundamental environment for the dissemination of opinions and sentiments, impacting areas such as politics, economics, and social behavior. However, the automated analysis of these sentiments still presents challenges, such as the need for intuitive tools capable of handling large volumes of data. Given this scenario, this study proposes Sentilytics, an application developed to perform automated sentiment analysis on social media. The application was built using Spring Boot, Angular, and Python, integrating data collection, text preprocessing, and sentiment classification into a unified and customizable workflow. To evaluate the application, a case study was conducted on the debate surrounding the end of the 6x1 work schedule, analyzing posts collected from Bluesky. The results demonstrated that Sentilytics is an efficient solution for sentiment analysis, providing graphical visualizations and interpretable insights. Regarding limitations, the initial version of the application relies solely on the VADER model, which has difficulties detecting irony and ambiguity, and its data collection is restricted to Bluesky, limiting the diversity of datasets. For future work, it is proposed to expand the application to other social networks and include more advanced sentiment analysis models.
